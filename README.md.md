# Smart Entity Timer

Persistent turn-on/turn-off timers for Home Assistant entities.

**Version:** 0.3.0  
**Minimum Home Assistant version:** 2026.7.0  
**Card API:** 2  
**Recommended card:** [Smart Entity Timer Card 0.3.0 or newer](https://github.com/abel-smart-timer/smart-entity-timer-card)

## What changes in 0.3.0

Smart Entity Timer is now modeled as **one Home Assistant integration entry with one config subentry per timer**.

```text
Smart Entity Timer
├── Bathroom light timer
├── Air conditioner timer
├── Bedroom fan timer
└── Water heater timer
```

This replaces the old 0.2.x model where every timer was an independent Helper config entry.

The practical result is a more intuitive UI:

- Smart Entity Timer is managed from **Settings → Devices & services → Integrations**.
- The integration has a single parent entry.
- Use **Add timer** to create additional timer subentries.
- Reconfigure each timer directly from the Smart Entity Timer integration page.
- All timer preferences, notification templates, target entity, and restart settings are managed in that timer's reconfigure flow.

The manifest uses `integration_type: hub` because the single parent entry manages multiple timer services, and `single_config_entry: true` prevents accidental duplicate parent entries.

## Upgrade from 0.2.x

On the first Home Assistant start with 0.3.0, existing Smart Entity Timer 0.1.x/0.2.x entries are consolidated automatically:

```text
Before
ConfigEntry A → Bathroom light
ConfigEntry B → Air conditioner
ConfigEntry C → Bedroom fan

After
Smart Entity Timer parent
├── Subentry → Bathroom light
├── Subentry → Air conditioner
└── Subentry → Bedroom fan
```

The migration preserves:

- existing `entity_id` values;
- existing entity `unique_id` values;
- timer persistent-storage keys;
- configured target entities and preferences;
- personalized notification templates;
- dashboard cards and automations that reference the existing status sensor.

For migrated timers, the old config-entry ID becomes the timer's stable internal ID. New 0.3.x timers use their config-subentry ID as their stable timer ID.

### Important upgrade procedure

Before upgrading from 0.2.x to 0.3.0:

1. **Wait for every active timer to finish or cancel it.** Do not update while any Smart Entity Timer is active or executing.
2. Create a Home Assistant backup.
3. Install/update Smart Entity Timer.
4. Restart Home Assistant.
5. Open **Settings → Devices & services → Integrations → Smart Entity Timer** and verify that all previous timers appear under the single integration entry.

Updating while a timer is active is not part of the supported upgrade procedure for the 0.2.x → 0.3.0 topology migration.

## Existing timer behavior remains unchanged

Each timer still creates five native entities:

- timer status sensor;
- duration number in whole minutes;
- final-action selector (`turn_on` / `turn_off`);
- start button;
- cancel button.

The timer still runs entirely in Home Assistant, so no dashboard or browser must remain open.

- Arbitrary whole-minute durations.
- Turn-on or turn-off final action.
- Manual cancellation.
- Automatic cancellation when the target reaches the requested state early.
- Final race-safe state check before execution.
- Persistent restart restoration during normal Home Assistant restarts.
- Expired OFF timers execute after startup by default.
- Expired ON timers are skipped after startup by default for safety.
- Personalized lifecycle notifications.
- Lifecycle events for advanced automations.
- Multiple independent timers.
- Card API v2.

## Supported domains

`switch`, `light`, `fan`, `climate`, `media_player`, `humidifier`, `input_boolean`, `remote`, and `water_heater`.

## Notifications

0.3.0 keeps the notification customization introduced in 0.2.0. Custom title/message fields support:

`{timer_name}`, `{target_name}`, `{target_entity}`, `{action}`, `{action_id}`, `{action_past}`, `{duration}`, `{duration_minutes}`, `{result}`, `{reason}`, `{finished_at}`, `{restored}`, `{default_title}`, `{default_message}`.

Leave a custom field blank to preserve the built-in message. The available variables and examples are also shown directly in the timer configuration UI.

## Lifecycle events

The public event contract remains:

- `smart_entity_timer.started`
- `smart_entity_timer.completed`
- `smart_entity_timer.cancelled`
- `smart_entity_timer.skipped`
- `smart_entity_timer.error`

## Card API v2 compatibility

Card API remains version 2. **Smart Entity Timer Card 0.3.0 is the recommended companion card.** Existing Smart Entity Timer Card 0.2.2 configurations also continue working without changes, including cards that point to migrated sensor entity IDs.

Smart Entity Timer Card 0.3.0 adds the mobile-first `mini` and `tile` layouts, compact action-button modes, and density controls without requiring any backend API change.

The status sensor remains the source of truth for the dashboard card and publishes `capabilities`, `constraints`, `companion_entities`, duration, action, timestamps, and timer lifecycle data.

## Actions

### Set duration and/or action while idle

```yaml
action: smart_entity_timer.set_values
target:
  entity_id: sensor.luz_del_bano_estado
data:
  duration_minutes: 75
  end_action: turn_off
```

### Start

```yaml
action: smart_entity_timer.start
target:
  entity_id: sensor.luz_del_bano_estado
```

### Cancel

```yaml
action: smart_entity_timer.cancel
target:
  entity_id: sensor.luz_del_bano_estado
```

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

Install or update **Smart Entity Timer** from HACS and restart Home Assistant when requested.

For an upgrade from 0.2.x, first follow the upgrade procedure above: stop/cancel all timers and create a backup.

For the dashboard, install **Smart Entity Timer Card 0.3.0 or newer** from HACS.

### Manual installation

1. Create a Home Assistant backup.
2. Ensure all Smart Entity Timer timers are idle if upgrading from 0.2.x.
3. Copy `custom_components/smart_entity_timer` into `/config/custom_components/smart_entity_timer`.
4. Replace the existing files when upgrading.
5. Restart Home Assistant.
6. Open **Settings → Devices & services → Integrations → Smart Entity Timer**.

Do not delete existing 0.2.x helpers before the first 0.3.0 start; they are the migration input.

## Validation

0.3.0 was validated on real Home Assistant installations for:

- clean installation on Raspberry Pi 5;
- adding multiple timers under one parent integration;
- centralized timer reconfiguration;
- blocking add/reconfigure while any timer is active;
- deleting one timer without affecting the others;
- migration of one and multiple 0.2.0 timers;
- preservation of existing entity IDs;
- Smart Entity Timer Card 0.3.0 compatibility through Card API v2;
- personalized notifications and lifecycle events after migration.

The repository also includes Python compilation, dependency-light regression tests, Hassfest, HACS validation, and a manual functional/migration test plan.
